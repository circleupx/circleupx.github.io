Hello World,

I am a software developer from South Florida. I work mostly with .NET & .NET Core. I am currently trying to expand my skills by learning Kubernetes.

Some of my current skills include

0. OAuth 2.0 (Waiting for 2.1 to formalized to learn it).
1. JSON:API (An excellent API specification in my opinion).
2. .NET & .NET Core (I love .NET Core).
3. Angular.
4. Terraform.
5. Packer
6. New Relic.
7. Postman API Testing.
8. Unit Testing (XUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions).
9. Git (I use fork <3)
