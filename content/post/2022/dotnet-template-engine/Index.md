In a [previous](/post/2022/microservice-generator) blog post I talked about the power of the [.NET template engine](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/) and how you can use the engine to create a [Microservice Generator](/post/2022/microservice-generator). 

In this blog post I want to explore the dotnet template engine to undestand all the capabilities it offers and how we can use them to our advantage.
