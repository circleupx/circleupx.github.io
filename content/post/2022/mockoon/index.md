A while back I made a blog post titled,[Tools For The Modern Day Developer](https://www.yunier.dev/post/2021/tools-for-the-modern-developer/), in which I listed the tools I thought at the time every developer should be using. Today I still stand by that list, but I would like to add an additional tool that lately has become super useful, that tool is [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/).

Mockoon is a free and open-source mock API tool created by [Guillaume](https://github.com/255kb) in 2017. It offers Docker support, a CLI, importing and exporting of Mockoon environments, it works with OpenAPI 3.0 files, it offers a template engine amonth many other things. In many ways it feel very similar to [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
