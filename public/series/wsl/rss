      <description>In my last post, Kubernetes In WSL - Connect to a service from Windows, I explored a few ways to connect to a Kubernetes service from the host machine, Windows. In the end of that blog post, I stated that using HostPort was the best option because at the time I did not know how to assign a static IP address to WSL.
Without using a static IP address, when WSL is restarted a new IP is assigned.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s post is a follow-up to my Use Kubernetes In WSL blog post, where I outlined how to install Kubernetes on WSL. As noted at the end of the post, I was having issues connecting from the host, a windows machine, to Kubernetes in WSL.
Connection Issue The main issue I was facing was that I could not connect to a pod running on Kubernetes using window&amp;rsquo;s localhost. Take the following Nginx deployment obtained from the official Kubernetes documentation.</description>

      <title>Remote Desktop Into WSL</title>

      <description>There have been a few instances where I could not figure out a problem within WSL. Problems that would be easier to fix if I had a UI instead of just an instance of the WSL shell. If you find yourself in such a situation know that you can install the UI portion, a Linux desktop on top of WSL. Once the UI has been installed you can RDP into the WSL instance allowing you to use the WSL distro as if it were natively installed on your machine.</description>

      <description>If you find yourself in need of having to use Kubernetes in WSL, know that it is possible, hard, but possible. It might require upgrading your machine to Windows 11 if you are on Windows 10 and a few other packages.
Prerequisite To get started we need to know what version of Windows you are on. This is important because Kubernetes will be installed using Microk8s, which requires having snap installed and working.</description>

      <title>Connect To The Internet From WSL</title>

      <description>Problem You have installed WSL successfully on your machine only to find out that you cannot connect to the internet. I have encountered this problem before sometimes it can be fixed externally, but from my experience, no matter what you do, you will end up having to mock around with the resolv.conf file within WSL, more on that later.
You may encounter an internet issue in WSL when the network administrator had configured Windows Defender to not allow local fire rules to be merged with rules applied at the enterprise level.</description>
