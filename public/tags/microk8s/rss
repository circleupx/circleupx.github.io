      <description>In my last post, Kubernetes In WSL - Connect to a service from Windows, I explored a few ways to connect to a Kubernetes service from the host machine, Windows. In the end of that blog post, I stated that using HostPort was the best option because at the time I did not know how to assign a static IP address to WSL.
Without using a static IP address, when WSL is restarted a new IP is assigned.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s post is a follow-up to my Use Kubernetes In WSL blog post, where I outlined how to install Kubernetes on WSL. As noted at the end of the post, I was having issues connecting from the host, a windows machine, to Kubernetes in WSL.
Connection Issue The main issue I was facing was that I could not connect to a pod running on Kubernetes using window&amp;rsquo;s localhost. Take the following Nginx deployment obtained from the official Kubernetes documentation.</description>

      <description>If you find yourself in need of having to use Kubernetes in WSL, know that it is possible, hard, but possible. It might require upgrading your machine to Windows 11 if you are on Windows 10 and a few other packages.
Prerequisite To get started we need to know what version of Windows you are on. This is important because Kubernetes will be installed using Microk8s, which requires having snap installed and working.</description>
