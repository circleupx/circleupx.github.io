      <description>HTML, CSS, and Javascript, are the languages of the world wide web, the platform. They are used to create websites, to make them interactive, and to make them beautiful. At one point in my career, I was more plugged into this world. A world that I feel I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen behind since I myself have not exclusively worked on a UI project since the days of AngularJS. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that I don&amp;rsquo;t do any front-end work anymore, it is just that these days I spent most of the time doing back-end development.</description>
