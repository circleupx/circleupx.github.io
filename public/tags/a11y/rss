      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t believe I&amp;rsquo;ve mention this before here, but I am a huge fan of Hey. By far the best email service I have ever used. What makes Hey even cooler is the team behind Hey sharing they engineering approach to different problems. Be that through various tweets or blog post like Scaling the hottest app in tech on AWS and Kubernetes which outline how they use k8s. Recently, they shared how to tackle ay11 under hey accessibility is a lot of work.</description>
