      <description>Introduction I have been spending my last few weeks sharpening up my Kubernetes skills, one area that I focused on was how to enable and use a Service Mesh in Kubernetes. A service mesh is a layer in your infrastructure that enables control of inbound and outboard traffic. It controls the traffic of any app or service that uses the network.
Kubernetes offers a wide range of Service Meshes, in this blog post I am going to concentrate on HashiCorp&amp;rsquo;s service mesh offering, Consul, though you may see other refer to it as Consul Connect, Consul Connect is a set of features that were added to Consul was in 2018 to enable service mesh support.</description>
