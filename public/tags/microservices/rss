      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, our industry has moved away from monolith architectures to microservice architectures. For a good number of &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackify.com/6-key-benefits-of-microservices-architecture/&#34;&gt;reasons&lt;/a&gt;, this trend continues to remain strong. One issue you may encounter with creating microservices if you are not using a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iU_IE6vnJ8&#34;&gt;monorepo&lt;/a&gt; is that you may have to build a new project whenever you need to add a new microservice to your app ecosystem. Creating a new project may include creating new repositories in Bitbucket/Github, configuring a continuous integration pipeline, adding build/deploy scripts, building the project based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ardalis/CleanArchitecture#design-decisions-and-dependencies&#34;&gt;some folder structure&lt;/a&gt; that has been determined by the team. It can also involve configuring how the service captures logs, communicating with other services, exposing an Open API definition, configuring a docker file, having a helm chart to deploy to k8s, installing external packages, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Improving A CPU-Intensive Node.js App</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I was asked to review a Web API written in Node.js. The API exposes an authentication endpoint, this authentication endpoint must be highly available, responsive, and it cannot become a bottleneck, otherwise, the user experience is severely impacted. Unfortunately, the endpoint had become a bottleneck and was impacting the overall performance of the application. Upon further review, it was determined that the problem was coming from a hashing function that takes the user&amp;rsquo;s password, hashes it, and compares the result with the stored hashed password from the database. Here is the code without the implementation details.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
