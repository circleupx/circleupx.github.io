      <description>I want to step away from software for this post to talk about some hardware. Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve owned a few routers, some have been really really good and some have been really bad. So far the best router I have owned is my current router, the UniFi Dream Machine. While I was mostly happy with my last router, the NighHawk AC1900, it did dropped the WiFi signal a lot, I think that at one point it was dropping the WiFi signal once a week.</description>
