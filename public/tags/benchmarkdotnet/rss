      <description>I was looking through some of my bookmarked Github issues when I rediscovered issue #32488, in that issue a comment was made that caught my attention. The comment stated that in .NET the order of interfaces impacts performance. This is because in the .NET CLR all class definitions have a collection of methods and interface definitions. Casting is a linear search that walks the interface definition. If you are constantly casting to an Interface located at the end then the CLR must do a longer walk.</description>
