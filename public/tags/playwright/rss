      <description>In the world of front end development there is no better tool than Lighthouse. Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can run it against any web page, public or requiring authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and more.
The only problem with lighthouse, at least from my experience, is that it is not used until after the app has been deployed.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t believe I&amp;rsquo;ve mention this before here, but I am a huge fan of Hey. By far the best email service I have ever used. What makes Hey even cooler is the team behind Hey sharing they engineering approach to different problems. Be that through various tweets or blog post like Scaling the hottest app in tech on AWS and Kubernetes which outline how they use k8s. Recently, they shared how to tackle ay11 under hey accessibility is a lot of work.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I was looking for an end-to-end testing framework. An alternative to Selenium, and all the other end-to-end frameworks. I came across a project called Playwright. Playwright is a new end-to-end framewrok created and maintained by Microsoft, it allows you to test web applications on different browsers. Some the major feature it provides are as follows.
Playwright has full API coverage for all modern browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge (with Chromium), Apple Safari (with WebKit) and Mozilla Firefox.</description>
