      <description>A few months ago I was looking for a new HTTP client to use within my applications. I first checked on awesome dotnet under the HTTP section to see what projects the .NET community is using instead of the default HTTP client. One that immediately stands out is RestSharp, this project has been around for a while and is overall a good choice, but I was looking for something new and fresh, that is when I came across Flurl.</description>
