      <description>When I first started to learn about GraphQL I was somewhat surprise to learn that the GraphQL specification did not provide any guidance or spoke of any methods to handle asynchronous request. By asynchronous request, I mean request that cannot be completed within your normal request-response context.
For example, take an API that aggregates orders by combining various types of filters, the API may allow you to filter by only orders that are greater than $100.</description>
